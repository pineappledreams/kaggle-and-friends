Kaggle, Data Science, Machine Learning, all the trials and tribulations in one simple repo!

YOU WILL NEED quite a lot of things, but とりあえず just

1) Make an virtual env with `py -m venv env`
2) Start it with ./env/Scripts/activate
3) Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4) Start jupyter notepad with `jupyter notebook`

So easy but it might take time sometimes you know!!
